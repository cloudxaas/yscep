YSCEP  -  Simple SCEP client for Unix

JZ: Yes, the code is VERY messy. At some point, I attempted to rewrite
it but eventually decided only to focus on what's absolutely needed for Y!.

WHAT IS YSCEP?
==============

YSCEP is a client-only implementation of the SCEP (Cisco System's Simple
Certificate Enrollment Protocol). YSCEP is based on the opensource SSCEP
with significant enhancement on operatibility, stability and flexibility. 

WHAT SCEP?
==========

(From the Cisco Systems White Paper):

SCEP is a PKI communication protocol which leverages existing
technology by using PKCS#7 and PKCS#10.  SCEP is the evolution of the
enrollment protocol developed by Verisign, Inc. for Cisco Systems, Inc.
It now enjoys wide support in both client and CA implementations.

The goal of SCEP is to support the secure issuance of certificates to
network devices in a scalable manner, using existing technology whenever
possible.  The protocol supports the following operations:

  CA and RA public key distribution
  Certificate enrollment
  Certificate and CRL query

Certificate and CRL access can be achieved by using the LDAP protocol,
or by using the query messages defined in SCEP.


YSCEP FEATURES
==============

Currently, YSCEP implements all of the SCEP operations using SCEP query
messages. There's no LDAP support, and probably there will never be
(that's why it is simple).

YSCEP has been tested successfully against the following CA products:

o OpenSCEP server (getca, enroll and getcrl works)*
o Windows2000 server CA + Microsoft SCEP module (works)
o SSH Certifier (getca and enroll works)
o iPlanet CMS (getca and enroll works)*
o VeriSign Onsite (getca and enroll works)**
o Entrust VPN Connect (getca and enroll works)***
o OpenCA (getca, enroll, getcrl and automatic approval works)****

(*) by default, subjectAltName extensions are dropped from certificate
(**) only DNS subjectAltName allowed (demo mode)
(***) demo requires to use /C=US/O=Entrust
(****) automatic approval according to newer SCEP drafts requires
       OpenCA 0.9.2.4 or higher

HOW TO USE
==========

Running the command "yscep" without any arguments should give you a list
of arguments and command line options.
